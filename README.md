## Unity Specific Features
- Transform
	- Position objects at far greater distance from the world's origin with double (64bit) precision transforms and origin shifting, allowing you to create much larger projects.
- Shader
	- Shader Graph integration.
- Editor integration
    - Scene camera navigation around spherical planet.
    - Move to View / Align with View / Align View to Selected, all supported by double precision transforms.
    - Double click navigation in the hierarchy works even for double precision transforms.
    - Origin shifting supports multi camera layout (Although at significant performance cost).
	- Undo and Redo are automatically managed for things like object Creation / Destroy / Duplicate.
	- Initialization and Dispose states are provided to help identify the context under which the operation was requested. Search for InitializationContext and DisposeContext in the Documentation for more information.
